A few months ago I had to generate a certificate for every participant at a contest. 
I used Microsoft Word to generate automatically all certificates using a list of participants. 
However, the output was a single file with one certificate per page. This was unconvenient since I had to send certificates to each participant. 
I wrote this function so I could split the original file into separate ones containing only each participants certifcate.
